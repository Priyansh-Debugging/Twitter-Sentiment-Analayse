# Twitter-Sentiment-Analayse🧠

creating a Scatter Plot b/w No. of Retweets and Net Score

# Skills used 🔧
- Python
- Functions, CSV file format/editing, loops etc.
- MS Excel

# ABOUT✏️
In this project we take demo twitter data which contains data like tweet, retweets, no. of replies etc.  
After that we take each tweet and and run the python code to check how many positive/negative words are  
in that tweet. Then we need to give a Net_ Score(how postive or negative the tweet is). The next step is  
simple we take the data created in a new csv file called resulting_data.csv and create a scatter plot.

# WORKING📈
- We create two functions get_pos and get_neg to get no. of positive/negative words respectively.
- In these functions we take each word at a time and remove any punctuations in the word using a  
  list of punctuation chracters.
- We also then check if the word is positive or negative by matching the words in given text files
  and returning back the result
- At last we compose all the necceasy data into the resulting_data.csv and plot the scatter plot.
